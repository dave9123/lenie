Problems I encounter:
- I tend to use my phone directly after I got out of bed as I use it as an alarm to wake me up.
	- Looking at your phone first thing in the morning can have several potential negative effects on your eyes and overall well-being according to https://www.healthshots.com/mind/mental-health/side-effects-of-using-phone-in-the-morning/.
	- The distractions such as notifications causes me to look at it first instead of preparing for the day.
